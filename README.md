## 📌 Features

- **MRI Image Preprocessing** – Cleans and prepares medical images for training.  
- **Deep Learning Model** – Detects the presence of brain tumors.  
- **Visualization** – Outputs prediction results and annotated images.  
- **Colab Integration** – Notebook is optimized for Google Colab usage.

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook BrainTimorDetector.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the cells step by step:
   - Mount Google Drive (for dataset access)  
   - Preprocess MRI images  
   - Train or load the detection model  
   - Evaluate results and visualize predictions  

3. Output will include:
   - Prediction results  
   - Tumor detection accuracy metrics  
   - Annotated MRI scans
